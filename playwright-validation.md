# Playwright Validation

When working on web apps, dashboards, sites, browser flows, or UI changes:

- Treat Playwright as the default validation tool for user-facing behavior.
- After implementing a change, validate the real behavior in a browser instead of relying only on code inspection.
- Prefer focused Playwright checks that prove the changed flow works end to end.
- If the project does not already have Playwright configured, set it up before claiming the browser behavior is verified.
- When practical, create or update Playwright tests for regressions in the area being changed.
- Report what was actually validated: route, action, expected result, and observed result.
- Do not claim UI/browser work is complete until Playwright verification or an explicit blocker is documented.

For non-UI/backend-only changes, use normal project-appropriate validation instead of forcing browser tests.
